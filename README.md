This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a project for the Udacity React Nano Degree. I used Material-ui to ease the creation of user elements.

You can start the project by installing the required libraried using `yarn install`
Then start the development webserver with `yarn start`
